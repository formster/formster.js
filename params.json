{"name":"Formster.js","tagline":"Client-side Form Tracking for Formster.io","body":"formster.js - the Formster.io Client-side Library\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n[Formster.io](http://formster.io) is a service to let you easily create and track sign up forms on static web pages. For more information and examples, visit [Formster.io](http://formster.io).\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\n### CDN (recommended)\r\nFormster.io maintains a CDN for the formster.js Library (built as a standalone). The format for requests to the CDN is:\r\n`protocol://cdn.formster.io/{version}/{script}`\r\n\r\nSimply drop a script tag in, and you're ready to go:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <script src=\"//cdn.formster.io/v0.3.0/formster.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Standalone\r\nThe formster.js library is built using [Browserify](http://browserify.org). Standalone libraries are available in `[build/](/build)`, and are exposed to the `window` object as `Formster` if no other module system is detected. Browserify uses [UMD](https://github.com/forbeslindesay/umd) to expose standalone modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Browserify\r\nTo include the client-side library in your own Browserify build, just install the formster.js package through [npm](http://npmjs.org):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    $ npm install formster.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n### Auto Tracking\r\nformster.js automatically scans the page for `<form>`s with a `className` of formster on `DOMReady`. Upon finding them, it instantiates the API and starts tracking. For the majority of cases, this automatic tracking is sufficient. To trigger auto tracking at a later time, call the `auto` method of the `Formster` object:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    function callMeLater() {\r\n      Formster.auto();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFormster.js keeps track of which forms it is tracking, so calling `auto` multiple times will *not* result in a duplication of data.\r\n\r\n### Manual Tracking\r\nIn some cases, more control over the form tracking process might be desirable.\r\n\r\n#### Instantiation\r\n`Formster` is a constructor for the API which takes the API key as its only parameter:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    var formster = new Formster('YOUR_API_KEY');\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Track Form\r\nTo track a form (including form clicks and submissions), pass the DOM element to the `trackForm` method:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    formster.trackForm($(\"#my-form-id\").get(0));\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Page Visit\r\nTo track a visit to a page, use the `visit` method with a page name as the only paramter:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    formster.visit(\"lead-form\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Underlying API Library\r\nThe guts of formster.js, most users will never need to touch the underlying library. However, it is exposed on the `Formster` object as `Formster.Api`. Any changes made to the `Api` object will be used in all future instances of `Formster`.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
